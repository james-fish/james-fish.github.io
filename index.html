							<h2>Hi! I'm James.</h2>
							<p><strong>I’m a design strategist and coach</strong> with over a decade of experience in design, UX, and innovation.</p>
							<p>I’m passionate about working on problems that affect real people in order to improve the world we live in. Personally compelling to me are healthcare, diversity and inclusion, economic justice, and civic spaces for the arts. Let’s think and act for the long term &mdash; rather than making one investor happy today, why not think about making the world better for us all, tomorrow?</p>

							<h2>Design Strategy</h2>
							<p>As a design strategist, I turn <strong>observations into insights</strong>, and <strong>insights into testable prototypes</strong>, using human-centered research methods.</p>
							<p> I work hand-in-hand with organizations to <strong>understand people and their needs, then test solutions</strong> for those needs in conjunction with the organization’s mission and vision. This might mean creating something new (like a website, product, service, or campaign) or improving on an existing offering. </p>
