										<h3>CONTEXT</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>INTO is an early-stage startup that aimes to help consumers make better decisions about which brands to purchase at the point of sale, via an app that conveys information and stories from the brands about ingredients, sustainability, origins, and producers (like farmers). While their concept tested well with pilot partner brands, and their app functioned on a technical level, they had not yet conducted usability, UX, concept, or value proposition testing with consumers, and only had ‘best guesses’ about whether (and why) a consumer would be willing to use their app in-store.</br></br>

									<div class="content">
										<p>The client team primarily asked for a test of their prototype usability and app user experience, but hadn't to date conducted any value proposition or concept resonance testing outside of friends and family. I recommended we try and fit some value prop explorations into the hourlong sessions, and recruit a wider range of participants, and wrote four variants of value proposition copy to test, each targeting different values.</p>

										<h3>Reflection</h3>
									</header>									
									<div class="content">
										<ul>
											<li>On this short engagement, I got to play the role of ‘a fresh set of eyes’ for a small and dedicated team. I have the feeling that many bootstrapped teams sometimes can benefit from an external voice or perspective to check assumptions and designs that the team may not have had the resources to examine, or have been overlooked through the (entirely normal) process of laser-focus on certain strategic objectives.</li>
											<li>Getting to set up and run a ‘1-day lab’ was a fun experience. While I usually fly the flag of deep and research-led innovation processes, I also feel that is a time and place for dedicated research phases, and a time and place to simply try covering a lot of ground in a short period of time - for teams who don’t have the resources to do so. </li>
											<li>We identified several high-priority usability fixes that could have become ‘show-stoppers’ for consumers using the app, and dozens more design choices that we recommended should be reworked for a smoother user experience. </li>

											<blockquote>"A Design Sprint is somewhat of a cram session like the old study days the night before a midterm.  James' approach to getting through the week kept us moving and no one felt stuck for long!”</blockquote>
											<blockquote>“James was able to grab our industry needs so quickly and on point.”</blockquote>
											<blockquote>"James kept it moving, participated in developing solutions, and of course his great sketching and summarizing abilities contributed to both above."</blockquote>
											<blockquote>“Very strong facilitator, keeping the group fairly flat.  In our day-to-day, we are often swayed by one or two heavyweights in the room!”</blockquote>
											<blockquote>"I can not say enough about your facilitation skill set.  You guided us in a very positive atmosphere to learn a  new product development tool.  Fabulous experience.”</blockquote>
