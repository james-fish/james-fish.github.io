							<h2>Redesigning a flexible, open-source logistics tool for food rescue coordinators and volunteers</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>Led redesign strategy of a web+mobile logistics tool that helps food rescues more efficiently coordinate between food donors and recipients, communicate with their volunteer base, and see where needs arise across their communities. Responsibilities spanned from stakeholder interviews to feature prioritization, concepting, wireframing, testing, iteration, and feedback. The interactive prototype tested well with the project partners, rescue coordinators, and volunteers and is currently in development.</p>

										<h3>CONTEXT</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>The Food Rescue Alliance aims to create a more just and less wasteful food system through both movement building and direct support to grassroots, community-based, food recovery programs. FRA supports food rescue organizations through peer-to-peer learning, trainings, consulting, resource sharing and workshops. FRA members encompass values such as: health equity, community-driven work, participation, volunteerism, and committing to working on systems-level change. (Find out more <a href="https://www.foodrescuealliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.)</br></br>

FRA approached Co.Lab to <strong>redesign Boulder Food Rescueâ€™s custom, open-source rescue coordination tool</strong>, the <a href="https://github.com/boulder-food-rescue/food-rescue-robot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Food Rescue Robot.</a> While core functionality worked, the interface was less-than-ideal for a common mobile volunteer use case, and many of the software quirks required odd workarounds - especially for those rescues who did not operate in the same model as BFR. A few rescues in the Alliance used the Robot; others were hesitant to adopt it given its idiosyncrasies.</p>

							<!-- SECTION  Challenge-->
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
<p> Our challenge was to understand how coordinators and volunteers across various different types of food rescues would want to interact with a logistics tool that would best serve their needs. To build something that could adequately scale across the Alliance, the resulting redesign needed to be simple enough to allow a coordinator to quickly do their work, yet flexible enough to allow for the various <strong>different models of food rescue work</strong> - while remaining <strong>accessible to staff and volunteers who may vary in their levels of technology access or familiarity</strong>.</p>

							<!-- SECTION Process 1-->

										<h3>Discovery and Needfinding</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
									<p>Twelve conversations with coordinators, volunteers, and donors across the Alliance, centering on their everyday rescue workflow and walking through the existing Food Rescue Robot together. I also participated in Alliance-wide calls to get a sense of different priorities and needs.</p>

									<h3>Reflection</h3>
									</header>									
									<div class="content">
									<ul>
									<li>This was a really enjoyable project to work on from start to handover. We were lucky to have a project partner committed to transparency, participatory design, and honest communication along the way - the process felt truly like a partnership rather than a â€˜client servicesâ€™ project. </li>
									<li>The most challenging (yet fun) aspect was designing a multi-user tool with a design language consistent for both coordinators and volunteers, yet one flexible enough to adapt to different use cases and needs - no two food rescues are organized exactly alike.</li>
									<li>This was an interesting blend of â€˜blue skyâ€™ and â€˜practical product evolutionâ€™ design strategy. Much of the concepting and wireframing we did was â€˜exploratory,â€™ intended to  put in front of the community to gauge input and feedback, while keeping in mind that developing everything at once would be unfeasible - and probably result in an over-stuffed featureset and UI. It was fun to be able to go blue sky, and then filter down to an MVP afterwards.</li>
									<li>It helped to have the time and space to get to know different folks across the Alliance and map out their workflows and needs. This was a project where I felt I had the time, resources, team support, and engagement from stakeholders, in order to really practice participatory design throughout the process.
